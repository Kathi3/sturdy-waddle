PROJECT REPORT

#ABSTRACT
This project aims to perform an in-depth analysis on the datasets given. We aim to understand our dataset before any further action can be done, for example, any algorithms formulated. 
In some instances, Data science is not really needed to solve all challenges we encounter and as such, it is important to analyze the problem statement and the data before we end up using personnel and finances performing a job that could have been done easily and using less finances.
In instances where data science is used, data wrangling needs to done to ensure the data is up to standard befor analysis even begins. The project aims to expound on data wrangling. 

#CONTEXT
Dog rating is a big idea on social media apps that generally is done for fun. The dog rating idea is usually supposed to be ona  scale of 1-10 but unfortunately, a significant number of people rate the pictures over 10. The data is also from different sources. As such, our data scale needs to be assembled and since is majorly littered with unresonable rating, we need to sort it.

2. CRISP-DM
In this Wrangle_Act project, the CRISP-DM model is used, which is a leading data mining
methodology. CRISP-DM has provided the guidelines that have enabled the execution of this
project in an organized and transparent manner. This model groups all tasks into six phases as
listed below.
● Business understanding
● Data understanding
● Data preparation
● Modeling
● Evaluation
● Deployment

3.1. BUSINESS UNDERSTANDING

The main task is to use the data that has been provided to answer the questions we set out to understand and to visualize the data so as to make it easier for non-data scientists  to understand and follow our work.
Our resources are as seen below.

● Personnel- an aspiring data scientist
● Data - Provided Dataset (tmdb Movies)
● Software- Jupyter Notebook

The project is scheduled to be evaluated and corrected if need be by completed by 6th September 2022.

3.2 DATA MINING OBJECTIVES & UNDERSTANDING
Some of our data mining objectives include:

1) To Load the Data and Access it using 3 methods.
API, CSV & TSV.
2) Combine the files to make 1 dataframe.
3) Tidy up the Data to geta  cleaner Dataframe.
4)Detect and correct 8 quality issues.
5) Visualize the data



4. DATA UNDERSTANDING
The data used in this project were provided as follows:
● Dataset Source - Provided by ALX-T - CSV
● API on Tweepy
● TSV
The project is done  on Jupyter Notebook .
On this platform, the data needs to be loaded before we proceed.
a) Importing the necessary libraries into Jupyter Notebook.
Next, we proceeded to load the dataset, CSV & TSV
b) Openig up a Twitter Developer's Account and using the credentials to access API.

DATA WRANGLING
Before analyzing the data, there is a need to understand the nature of the data presented. 
The dataset had some null values. Since there were quit a number, the threshold code was used to ensure it hastens the process. The decision made was to drop them as they would interfere with the work while bringing no analysis benefits.
There was some duplicated columns and as such, the columns were dropped.

DATA EXPLORATION
The idea of this section is to create visualizations that can actually prove or disprove the objectives we set out to achieve to help us make more informed decisions.
The idea is also to have diagrams that were easy to follow for people wo may not be in the DS field.

CONCLUSIONS & RECOMMENDATION

From the descriptive analysis done on the data we can see that we have achieved what our objectives were.
1) To Load the Data and Access it using 3 methods - Able to load the data in 3 methods.
2) Combined the files to make 1 dataframe.
3) Tidied up the Data to geta  cleaner Dataframe.
4) Detected and corrected 8 quality issues.
5) Visualized the data

Recommendations - 
The guideline given was helpful but didn't necessarily reflect the actual work as some of the codes given didnt work. More needs to be done to help in the process.
The cleaning process is tedious. Allow yourself to pace it least it feels overwhelming.
